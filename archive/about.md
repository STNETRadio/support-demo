# ‚ùì What is Account Archived

Account Archived is the process where online accounts that are no longer in use are retained for data deletion or for future use. This process can be categorized into several types:

## 1. Accounts Awaiting Data Deletion

These are accounts containing significant data used for communication, such as posts, media files, etc. There is a specified time frame for data deletion, typically around 10-30 days. Currently, we do not have accounts of this type in our service.

## 2. Permanent Archived Accounts

These are accounts that are no longer in use but require retention of data within the account, including contact information or for the use of other accounts. You can find more information [here](x.md).

## 3. Reactivated Accounts

These are accounts that were previously used and have been brought back into service. The decision to reactivate is often influenced by the followers associated with those accounts.

If you have additional questions, please contact our customer service team, available 24/7.
